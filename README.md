# Maze Solver Project

Guided project from boot.dev.

Creates and solves a maze with a depth first search.

The maze is created based on a random seed, it is ensured, that it is possible to solve and the algorithm
shows the progress of the algorithm with different colors.

Possible to dos:
- create GUI for input of size of the maze and used colors
- implement a breadth first algorithm and let the user chose which is used to create and/or solve the maze
